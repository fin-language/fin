# Releases
Test/interim releases are not documented here.

---

### Fixed
- Transpiler - fix `c_array` of reference types
- Transpiler - allow nullable types like `Led?`, convert `null` to `NULL`

---

## [0.2.3-alpha]
### Added
- Transpiler - support enumerations
    - They can't be nested inside a class yet.
- Transpiler - support fin numeric `wrap_lshift()`
    - ex: `(my_u8 + 10).wrap_lshift(i + 2)` --> `(uint8_t)((my_u8 + 10) << (i + 2))`

---

## [0.2.2-alpha]
### Added
- Transpiler - support narrowing casts.
    - ex: `b = (u8)my_i32;` --> `b = (uint8_t)my_i32;`
- Transpiler - support `u8.narrow_from(some_arg)`
    - ex: `u8.narrow_from(my_i32)` --> `(uint8_t)my_i32`
- Transpiler - support c style naked arrays `c_array<T>`
- Improve 1-1 transpilation of fin to C99
    - removed indentation from C# and other small improvements

--- 

## [0.2.1-alpha]
### Added
- Moved Transpiler into main finlang nuget package
- `transpiler.GetListOfAllGeneratedFiles()`

### Fixed
- Transpiler supports XML doc comments `///<summary>...</summary`

--- 

## [0.2.0-alpha]
### Fixed
- fix ambiguous cast between fin types

### Added
- [ffi] attribute for c# classes (foreign function interface)

--- 

## [0.1.5-alpha]
### Added
- integer self type declaration like `my_u16.u16_`
    - https://github.com/fin-language/fin/issues/21

---

## [0.1.4-alpha]
### Added
- `narrow_to_x()` methods like `u32.narrow_to_u8()`
- `narrow_from()` methods like `u8.narrow_from_u32()`

### Fixed
- casting a C# int type to a fin type now uses a narrowing (checked) conversion.
- removed wrapping methods from signed types for now (C implementation defined behavior).

---

## [0.1.0-alpha]
Still only simulating in C#. Not generating C99 yet.

### Added
- `c_array<T>` naked C style array (no length)
- fin integer types `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64` with most operators overloaded
- math unsafe mode and user error provided mode
- Err object for handling errors
    - detects if not checked and cleared when going out of scope
- `mem.stack()` and `mem.heap()` for allocating memory
