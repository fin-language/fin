# Breaking Changes ðŸŒ±
Fin is very experimental right now! I wouldn't recommend using it for anything other than for exploration and toy examples right now.

We will occasionally make changes to `fin` that may affect your projects.

You can easily find changes by searching for `"### Change"` in this markdown file.

## [0.???]
### Fixed
- fix delegate and pointer type parameters
    - https://github.com/fin-language/fin/issues/86

### Added
- add duplicate include statements after fin type is resolved to c header file
    - we had files with multiple `#include <stdint.h>` statements because fin types like u8, u16, etc. all resolved to `#include <stdint.h>`.

## [0.3.0]
### Added
- Transpiler - initial support for a field to be an actual class object type and not just a pointer to it.
    - field: `[mem] public SomeObj obj;`

    - Currently only supports fields (not local variables).
    - Doesn't need `[mem]` because it is implied. You can add it though.
- Transpiler - add ability to customize the output file path and name
	- See `transpiler.SetFileNamer()` for more details.

    - Also outputs source file path.
    - See `transpiler.Options` for more details.
- Transpiler - support `SimOnly.run(() => { /* code */ })` for running code in simulation mode only.
    - This code can be in constructors, or local methods...
- Transpiler - support C# binary/hex literals with underscore separators
    - `0b1010_1110` --> `0b10101110`
    - `0x1234_5678` --> `0x12345678`
- Transpiler - initial support for C# ref and out parameters of primitives
- Transpiler - initial support for C# in parameters of primitives

- Transpiler - fix pass `self` to method calls like `this.toggle()`
- Transpiler - prevent .h file from including itself in the same file

---

## [0.2.4]
### Added

- Transpiler - handle an object calling its own method without `this` like `toggle()`
- Transpiler - allow nullable types like `Led?`, convert `null` to `NULL`
- Transpiler - ignore  `required`, `virtual`, `override`, `sealed`, `in`
- Transpiler - private methods are prefixed with `PRIVATE_`

### Fixed
- Transpiler - fix `c_array` of reference types

---

## [0.2.3]
### Added
- Transpiler - support enumerations
    - They can't be nested inside a class yet.
- Transpiler - support fin numeric `wrap_lshift()`
    - ex: `(my_u8 + 10).wrap_lshift(i + 2)` --> `(uint8_t)((my_u8 + 10) << (i + 2))`

---

## [0.2.2]
### Added
- Transpiler - support narrowing casts.
    - ex: `b = (u8)my_i32;` --> `b = (uint8_t)my_i32;`
- Transpiler - support `u8.narrow_from(some_arg)`
    - ex: `u8.narrow_from(my_i32)` --> `(uint8_t)my_i32`
- Transpiler - support c style naked arrays `c_array<T>`
- Improve 1-1 transpilation of fin to C99
    - removed indentation from C# and other small improvements

---

--- 

## [0.2.0]
### Fixed
- fix ambiguous cast between fin types

### Added
- [ffi] attribute for c# classes (foreign function interface)

--- 

## [0.1.5]

- integer self type declaration like `my_u16.u16_`
    - https://github.com/fin-language/fin/issues/21

---

## [0.1.4]
### Added
- `narrow_to_x()` methods like `u32.narrow_to_u8()`
- `narrow_from()` methods like `u8.narrow_from_u32()`

### Fixed
- casting a C# int type to a fin type now uses a narrowing (checked) conversion.
- removed wrapping methods from signed types for now (C implementation defined behavior).

---

## [0.1.0]
Still only simulating in C#. Not generating C99 yet.

### Added
- `c_array<T>` naked C style array (no length)
- fin integer types `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64` with most operators overloaded
- math unsafe mode and user error provided mode
- Err object for handling errors
    - detects if not checked and cleared when going out of scope
- `mem.stack()` and `mem.heap()` for allocating memory
