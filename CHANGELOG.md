--- 

## [0.1.5-alpha]

    - https://github.com/fin-language/fin/issues/21

---

## [0.1.4-alpha]
### Added
- `narrow_to_x()` methods like `u32.narrow_to_u8()`
- `narrow_from()` methods like `u8.narrow_from_u32()`

### Fixed
- casting a C# int type to a fin type now uses a narrowing (checked) conversion.
- removed wrapping methods from signed types for now (C implementation defined behavior).

---

## [0.1.0-alpha]
Still only simulating in C#. Not generating C99 yet.

### Added
- `c_array<T>` naked C style array (no length)
- fin integer types `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64` with most operators overloaded
- math unsafe mode and user error provided mode
- Err object for handling errors
    - detects if not checked and cleared when going out of scope
- `mem.stack()` and `mem.heap()` for allocating memory
