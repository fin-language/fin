## [0.2.?]
### Added
- Transpiler - add ability to customize the output file path and name
- Transpiler - add default options to output finlang version, date/time, and MD5 filepath.
    - Also outputs source file path.
- Transpiler - support `SimOnly.run(() => { /* code */ })` for running code in simulation mode only.
- Transpiler - support C# binary/hex literals with underscore separators
    - `0b1010_1110` --> `0b10101110`
    - `0x1234_5678` --> `0x12345678`
- Transpiler - initial support for C# ref and out parameters of primitives
- Transpiler - initial support for C# in parameters of primitives

---

## [0.2.6]
### Added
- Transpiler - initial support for interfaces
    - interface inheritance, multiple interfaces, interface conversions...
- Transpiler - allow generating C to ignore unused warning: `FinC.ignore_unused(some_var)`
- Transpiler - support FFI on classes that implement interfaces
- Transpiler - support FFI on specific methods

---

## [0.2.5]
### Fixed
- Transpiler - now tracks header dependency of type `T` contained in `c_array<T>`
- Transpiler - fix pass `self` to method calls like `this.toggle()`
- Transpiler - prevent .h file from including itself in the same file

---

## [0.2.4]
### Added
- Transpiler - support nested classes/enums although indentation is not correct yet
- Transpiler - handle an object calling its own method without `this` like `toggle()`
- Transpiler - allow nullable types like `Led?`, convert `null` to `NULL`
- Transpiler - ignore  `required`, `virtual`, `override`, `sealed`, `in`
- Transpiler - private methods are prefixed with `PRIVATE_`

### Fixed
- Transpiler - fix `c_array` of reference types

---

## [0.2.3]
### Added
- Transpiler - support enumerations
    - They can't be nested inside a class yet.
- Transpiler - support fin numeric `wrap_lshift()`
    - ex: `(my_u8 + 10).wrap_lshift(i + 2)` --> `(uint8_t)((my_u8 + 10) << (i + 2))`

---

## [0.2.2]
### Added
- Transpiler - support narrowing casts.
    - ex: `b = (u8)my_i32;` --> `b = (uint8_t)my_i32;`
- Transpiler - support `u8.narrow_from(some_arg)`
    - ex: `u8.narrow_from(my_i32)` --> `(uint8_t)my_i32`
- Transpiler - support c style naked arrays `c_array<T>`
- Improve 1-1 transpilation of fin to C99
    - removed indentation from C# and other small improvements

--- 

## [0.2.1]
### Added
- Moved Transpiler into main finlang nuget package
- `transpiler.GetListOfAllGeneratedFiles()`

### Fixed
- Transpiler supports XML doc comments `///<summary>...</summary`

--- 

## [0.2.0]
### Fixed
- fix ambiguous cast between fin types

### Added
- [ffi] attribute for c# classes (foreign function interface)

--- 

## [0.1.5]
### Added
- integer self type declaration like `my_u16.u16_`
    - https://github.com/fin-language/fin/issues/21

---

## [0.1.4]
### Added
- `narrow_to_x()` methods like `u32.narrow_to_u8()`
- `narrow_from()` methods like `u8.narrow_from_u32()`

### Fixed
- casting a C# int type to a fin type now uses a narrowing (checked) conversion.
- removed wrapping methods from signed types for now (C implementation defined behavior).

---

## [0.1.0]
Still only simulating in C#. Not generating C99 yet.

### Added
- `c_array<T>` naked C style array (no length)
- fin integer types `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64` with most operators overloaded
- math unsafe mode and user error provided mode
- Err object for handling errors
    - detects if not checked and cleared when going out of scope
- `mem.stack()` and `mem.heap()` for allocating memory
